# Simple-Banking-System
## JetBrains Academy projects ([Hyperskill.org](https://hyperskill.org))

The program allows to create a bank account, log into it and perform simple operations: check balance, add income, transfer money to another account and close an account. The account data is stored in the **SQLite** database and is accessible from the program with the help of **SQL**. Also, there is the **Luhn Algorithm** for checking card number implemented in the project.
